  abstract = {Many plants have evolved floral traits that, in effect, filter pollinator communities and promote pollination by efficient pollinators. Most documented pollinator filter traits act to deter or reduce visitation rates by a subsect of the community of floral visitors. However, a recently described pollinator filter termed `pollinator recognition' (PR) acts at a stage after a pollinator visit. PR was first documented experimentally in Heliconia tortuosa whereby pollen tube germination -- a proxy for reproduction -- was enhanced following visits from morphologically specialized pollinators, but not generalists. This is thought to promote outcrossing among plants by preferentially investing in reproduction following visits by long-ranging hummingbirds with specialized bill shapes. To date, this plant behavior has only been described in H. tortuosa, but, if widespread, could have important ecological implications; given declines in abundances of specialist pollinators, visits by generalists would not buffer the loss of pollination services to plants with PR. We therefore tested for PR in four taxa spread widely across the Heliconiaceae. We corroborated previous results that visits by long-billed, but not short-billed hummingbirds increased pollen tubes in H. tortuosa with aviary experiments that standardized pollen quality and minimized variation in pollen quantity. Across species, we found great variation in pollen tube responses to experimental treatments. For one species (H. rostrata), we found increased numbers of pollen tubes in those visited by hummingbirds compared to hand pollination alone, regardless of the visiting bird's bill morphology, indicating recognition of hummingbirds in general. In other cases, hummingbird visits decreased pollen tube counts compared to hand pollinations alone. Furthermore, our results could not substantiate any specific mechanism for pollinator recognition and highlight the need for further work on the complexities of and variability in reproductive strategies across plant taxa.},

  abstract = {Self-incompatibility was studied in populations of 19 species of Central American Heliconia. Pollen tube growth and in some cases fruit set were used to determine the extent of physiological self-incompatibility in each species. Responses ranged from total self-rejection in one species to full self-compatibility in the majority of taxa studied. Partial self-incompatibility, as expressed in the number of styles accepting self-pollen and the number of pollen tubes penetrating these styles, was found in one species. Levels of autogamy in excess of 25\% were detected in five species. The prevalence of self-compatibility in these herbaceous members of the understory of tropical wet forests contrasts with the common occurrence of obligate outcrossers in the canopy layers. The availability of long distance pollinators and low daily flower output may promote outcrossing despite the scarcity of physiological selfincompatibility in these plants.},

  abstract = {Mutualistic relationships, such as those between plants and pollinators, may be vulnerable to the local extinctions predicted under global environmental change. However, network theory predicts that plant--pollinator networks can withstand species loss if pollinators switch to alternative floral resources (rewiring). Whether rewiring occurs following species loss in natural communities is poorly known because replicated species exclusions are difficult to implement at appropriate spatial scales. We experimentally removed a hummingbird-pollinated plant, Heliconia tortuosa, from within tropical forest fragments to investigate how hummingbirds respond to temporary loss of an abundant resource. Under the rewiring hypothesis, we expected that behavioural flexibility would allow hummingbirds to use alternative resources, leading to decreased ecological specialization and reorganization of the network structure (i.e. pairwise interactions). Alternatively, morphological or behavioural constraints---such as trait-matching or interspecific competition---might limit the extent to which hummingbirds alter their foraging behaviour. We employed a replicated Before-After-Control-Impact experimental design and quantified plant--hummingbird interactions using two parallel sampling methods: pollen collected from individual hummingbirds (`pollen networks', created from {$>$}300 pollen samples) and observations of hummingbirds visiting focal plants (`camera networks', created from {$>$}19,000 observation hours). To assess the extent of rewiring, we quantified ecological specialization at the individual, species and network levels and examined interaction turnover (i.e. gain/loss of pairwise interactions). H. tortuosa removal caused some reorganization of pairwise interactions but did not prompt large changes in specialization, despite the large magnitude of our manipulation (on average, {$>$}100 inflorescences removed in exclusion areas of {$>$}1 ha). Although some individual hummingbirds sampled through time showed modest increases in niche breadth following Heliconia removal (relative to birds that did not experience resource loss), these changes were not reflected in species- and network-level specialization metrics. Our results suggest that, at least over short time-scales, animals may not necessarily shift to alternative resources after losing an abundant food resource---even in species thought to be highly opportunistic foragers, such as hummingbirds. Given that rewiring contributes to theoretical predictions of network stability, future studies should investigate why pollinators might not expand their diets after a local resource extinction.},

  abstract = {Nine hummingbird---pollinated species of Heliconia occur together at Finca La Selva, in the wet Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica. In forest habitats, Heliconia clumps (clones) are typically small; in more open areas, many clumps attain large size. This probably reflects differences in light intensity and degree of vegetative competition in these habitats. Nine species of hummingbirds regularly visit Heliconia flowers at La Selva. The four hermits are nonterritorial, traplining foragers with long, curved bills. Non---hermits frequently hold territories at Heliconia clumps, and have short, straight bills. Pollination by hermits tends to produce more cross---pollination; territorial hummingbirds increase self---pollination. Different Heliconia species appear to be specialized for pollination by either hermits on non---hermits, largely through components of the caloric phenotype: amount and timing of nectar production, rate of inflorescene and flower production, and morphological paramerters that affect the energetic efficiency of nectar---harvesting hummingbirds. Habitat may influence pollination systems through its effects on clump size and thus on the number of flowers a clump can have at any one time. Ultimately, specialization for hermits or non---hermits may depend on the degree of self---compatibility of the different Heliconia species. Hermit---pollinated Heliconia mostly show sequential and nonoverlapping flowering peaks, probably resulting from competition for pollinators and/or selection against hybridization. Two hermit---pollinated species bloom simultanesoulsy, thereby inducing the birds to utilize an other---wise little---used microhabitat. Heliconia species pollinated by non---hermits bloom in the early to middle rainy season, and are mostly separated by habitat. Isolating mechanisms among sympatric Heliconia species involve both spatial and temporal patterns of partioning available pollinators. Floral parameters include mechanical (different site of pollen deposition on the bird) and ethological (caloric and visual factors affecting flower choice) mechanisms. Selection for pollinator specificity may result in convergence of blooming peaks, provided that other isolating mechanisms are present. Human activity has broken down some habitat barriers by producing large areas of second growth.},
