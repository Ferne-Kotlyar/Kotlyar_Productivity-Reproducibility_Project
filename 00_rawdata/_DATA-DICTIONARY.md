## Species Nectar Dye Data Description

Data from an experiment where the presence/absence of dye on stigmas and anthers of *Heliconia tortuosa* flowers was recorded based on hummingbird species and sex.

## Variable Descriptions

-   **species:** bill replicas of the following 4 hummingbird species were used in this experiment:
    -   GREH: green hermit, *Phaethornis guy* (traplining hummingbird)
    -   VISA: violet sabrewing, *Campylopterus hemileucurus* (traplining hummingbird)
    -   RTAH: rufous-tailed, *Amazilia tzacatl* (territorial hummingbird)
    -   CRWO: crowned woodnymph, *Thalurania colombica* (territorial hummingbird)
-   **sex:** female (F) or male (M) bills.
-   **dye_on_stigma:** presence or absence of dye on stigma after having inserted and extracted a bill replica. This was either: no (N), yes (Y), little, lots, or maybe (M). Later, this was converted to the binary yes or no.
-   **dye_on_anthers:** same as above, but on the anthers.
-   **flower:** the collected flower was either *open* (likely less nectar), *bagged* (likely more nectar), or used in a *treatment* as a pollen donor (likely less nectar and less pollen).
-   **person:** who inserted and extracted the bill replica (either Ferne or Mike).
-   **bill_stained:** did the bill get stained with dye upon insertion and extraction.
-   **date:** date of experiment.
-   **collection_time:** collection time of the flower (this time was approximate).
-   **dye_time:** time of insertion and extraction of the bill replicas (this time was approximate).
-   **notes**
