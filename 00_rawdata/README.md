These data were collected by Ferne Kotlyar in the field in Costa Rica with the help from Michael Atencio.

## Background Information

According to over 60 slow-motion videos (240 fps) of common, wild *Heliconia tortuosa* visitors, traplining hummingbirds appear to displace nectar and deposit it on the stigma upon exiting the flower. This appeared to occur less frequently with territorial hummingbirds. To test this species-specific difference, we conducted nectar dye experiments using 3D printed bill replicas of *H. tortuosa*â€™s primary visitors: two traplining hummingbirds (green hermits, *Phaethornis guy,* and violet sabrewings, *Campylopterus hemileucurus*) and two territorial hummingbirds (rufous-tailed, *Amazilia tzacatl* and crowned woodnymphs, *Thalurania colombica*). Bill replicas were generated from photogrammetry scans (Medina et al. 2024) of each species and sex.

## Data Collection Methods

We collected *H. tortuosa* flowers from the field, then injected \~0.05 mL of fuchsin dye into the base of the corolla right above the nectar chamber. Next, we inserted and extracted one of the bill replicas from the four species listed above into the flower. During this process, we tried to reproduce traplining hummingbird behaviour as closely as possible according to the slow motion videos. Immediately after removing the bill from the flower, the anthers and stigma were placed under a field microscope (Carson MicroFlip 100x-250x LED), and the presence (or absence) of dye was recorded on the anthers and stigma separately. Each species was used 13-14 times, for a total of n = 55.
